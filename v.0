Conversational UX Meetup - Code of Conduct

Conversational UX Design (CUX) Meetup is dedicated to empowering every person to achieve more in their professional careers as designers, or any other role related to human-centric Conversational Artificial Intelligence. 

This includes CUX Design Meetup events where we seek to provide a respectful, friendly, professional experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, age, race or religion.

We DO NOT tolerate any behaviour that is harassing or degrading to any individual, in any form. Individuals are responsible for knowing and abiding by these standards. We encourage everyone to assist in creating a welcoming and safe environment. 

Please report to the organizers any concerns, suspicious or disruptive activity behaviour via the Meetup website.

CUX Design Meetup reserves the right to refuse admittance to or remove any person from an event at any time at its discretion.
